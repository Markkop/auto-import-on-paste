# ðŸ“© Auto Import on Paste README

This extension automatically attempts to import functions when you paste code containing a function call that is not yet imported.  
It detects the function, goes to the end of the function name, call VSCode suggestions and apply the first one.  
It will be triggered by any code change, not only pasted code.
