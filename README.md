# Auto Import on Paste README

This README provides details about the "Auto Import on Paste" extension. This extension automatically attempts to import functions or modules when you paste code containing a function call that is not yet imported. This can streamline your development workflow by reducing the need to manually add imports.

## Features

- **Auto Import Detection**: Automatically detects when a function or module is pasted into your code and tries to import it.
- **Language Support**: Currently supports JavaScript and TypeScript files.
- **Status Bar Control**: Easily enable or disable the extension directly from the VS Code status bar.
- **Error Handling**: Provides notifications and logs errors if the auto import process encounters issues.

### Screenshots

To be added later.

> Tip: Consider using animated GIFs to demonstrate the extension in action.

## Requirements

No specific requirements or dependencies are needed to use this extension.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

- `autoImportOnPaste.enable`: Enable/disable the auto-import functionality. Toggle this from the status bar as well.
- `autoImportOnPaste.supportedLanguages`: List of languages that the extension supports. Defaults to JavaScript and TypeScript.
