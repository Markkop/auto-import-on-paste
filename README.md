## Requirements

No specific requirements or dependencies are needed to use this extension.

## Usage

It detects the function, checks if it is already imported, goes to the end of the function name, calls VSCode suggestions, and applies the first one.  
It will be triggered by any code change, not only pasted code.  
It is limited to only do that if only one function is detected. We can make it cover multiple functions, but it might take more time and be inconvenient.
